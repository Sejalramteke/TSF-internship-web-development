            <h1>It's about making a difference</h1>
            <p> Let's bribe the gods, by helping the pauper,let's do holy will, by giving a book to poor
                <br>Let's wake up to a new world, let's start a new life,where every kid has a pen, and only a chef holds the knife
                <br>Education make a difference, they too are a peice of art,lets help them in either way possible, as we consider ourselves smart
                <br>The time will never be right, it will always be a fight,if you can't donate by your own self, then it will never be bright 
                <br>So just leave the blame, come on put the claim,you get only one life, the change we want let's became!</p>
